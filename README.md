# Generating music

The basic idea of the project is to generate a guitar composition based on a set of midi files.
We will do this using an autoencoder, a variational autoencoder and a long short-term memory. 

It is necessary to install the music21 package. You can do this following the command:
- pip3 install â€“upgrade music21


Music21 is a Python-based toolkit for computer-aided musicology. You can find more about this package on [official website](hhttps://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/index.html)
